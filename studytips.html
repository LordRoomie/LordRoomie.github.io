Studying can be a very daunting prospect, especially considering the other options present to you alongside studying which appear much more enjoyable at that moment. What ought to be said before anything else in this guide though is that you will not consistently study over any great period of time if you dislike studying.
    
Your opinion on studying is what effects your willingness to study and you can affect your opinion. It is not studying itself which causes you to dislike studying. What affect us is our opinion of things and not the thing itself for if another person were in your position they'd react differetly.
<pr> 
    So, what can we do regarding our opinon of studying? For one, we have to understand fully a few things:
    <ul>
    <li>When I study, why do I study? </li>
    <li>Why should I study?</li>
    <li>What thoughts often convince me to not study?</li>
    <li>How do I overcome these thoughts via prevention?</li>
    </ul>
    
    Via giving deep thought to all four of these questions, we are then able to understand why we study when we do, why should we actually study, what you do that prevents you from studying, and how you overcome that.
</pr>
    

    In truth, all the chrome extensions or pieces of advice in the world will not help you greatly in studying. What is required though, is a meaningful understanding of the task at hand. Through thought on these questions, you are better able to study better because of your commitment to goals which are clear and achieveable. You can certainly study for a long while and do very well by feeling horrible whenever you don't do well but this is unhealthy and ultimately harms more than it helps.
